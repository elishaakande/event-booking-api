```

### Available Endpoints

| **Method** | **Endpoint**                  | **Description**                                                       | **Auth Required** |

## You can also use `https://event-booking-api-elisha.onrender.com` to test tha API

## Rate Limiting

To prevent the abuse of the API, I have implemented rate limiting:

- **15 minutes window.**
- **100 requests per window per IP.**

### Rate Limit Error

```bash
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Too many requests, please try again later."
}
```

## Logging System

- **Winston** is used to log every request and track errors.
- Logs are stored in logs/combined.log and logs/error.log.

### Example Log

```bash
{
  "message": "POST /api/events/book - 192.168.0.1",
  "level": "info",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-06T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Testing API Remotely

- Use `https://event-booking-api-elisha.onrender.com` as the host name
- Use any of the API endpoint from above
- Don't forget to use `x-api-key: your_secure_api_key` in your request header
